# Getting Started

# Unsolved Problems
- I wanted to be able to save a favorite fact and have it be added to the favorites page. It was more of a challenge than I expected it to be. I was close to getting it functioning but then I ran into other issues that I had to resolve first. My project was failing to deploy on Netlify. Once it finally sucessfully deployed, I was no longer able to sign-up or login, and can't access the rest of my project from that link. I created a second repo for the front-end and back-end without deployment. I am able to access from project now from the my server.

# Future Enhancements
- Add images
- I would like to eventually implement CRUD so a user could create, edit or delete a fact.
